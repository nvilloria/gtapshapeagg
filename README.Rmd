# gtapshapeagg

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

## Overview

`gtapshapeagg` takes advantage of R's scripting capabilities to
organize the execution of several GEMPACK programs that (1) split the
regional land rents in the standard GTAP database to subnational
boundaries, such as Agroecological Zones, and (2) aggregate the
regions and countries of the GTAP database with subnational land rents
using a standard aggregation template written as a GEMPACK text
file. The package is designed to work seamlessly with files produced
by the `gtapshapeagg` package and should be considered its companion.

`gtapshapeagg` relies on modified versions of the programs of
[**FlexAgg2**]((https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/flexagg2.asp)),
to aggregate the regions and countries of the standard GTAP
database. The land rents are dissagregated using a program graciously
provided by the GTAP center.

The source code of these programs is provided with `gtapshapeagg`, in
the folder `inst/tablo`. To make them operational they must be
compiled by running `setup_gtapshapeagg()`. `setup_gtapshapeagg()`
creates fortran executable files of the needed gempack programs and
places them in the subfolder `gempack` in the current working
directory [i.e., `getwd()`]. The workflow assumes that the computer is
already setup to [compile source-code GEPMPACK
programs](https://www.copsmodels.com/gpinstall.pdf) and that the user
is has secured the necessary sofware licences.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `gtapshapeagg` directly
from GitHub using the following commands:

```r
## Install devtools if you don't already have it
install.packages("devtools")

## Install gtapshapeagg from GitHub
devtools::install_github("nvilloria/gtapshapeagg")

## Setup gtapshapeagg (compile tablo programs, if they are not
## compiled--they will be placed in the folder `gempack` in the
## current directory [i.e., getwd()]):
setup_gtapshapeagg()

## For testers/reviewers, unzip `gsdgdat11cMV6.har` (password protected):
unzip_gtapdata()

```

## Usage

The package is designed to work seamlessly with two files. One is a
file with eight headers that contain land cover and land use data by
subnational boundary and region. The other file has the sets (regions,
products, and subnational boundaries.) These files are created by
`gtapshape`. In addition, the program requires a fully disagregated
standard gtap database with its standard sets. If a regional or
sectoral aggregation is required, the parameter file of the standard
GTAP database need to be provided.

The required files can be in any directory specified by the user. In
order to make `gtapshapeagg` self-contained, we have prepackaged data
and set files for 18 AEZs as well as the standard GTAP database V11c,
GTAP Model V6 including parameters, and sets. The GTAP database is
password protected and we will not share the password, so please do
not ask. For the programs to run, licensed users should specify the
location (path file) of their har file.

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use `gtapshapeagg`:

```r
# Load the package
library(gtapshapeagg)

# Example: Splitting national land rents into subnational boundaries
splitlr(
    # This is the data file with LULC by subantional boundaries,
    # regions and products, created by gtapshape:
    landdat = system.file("from-gtapshape", "gtaplulc-aez18.har",
                          package = "gtapshapeagg"),
    ## These are the LULC sets from gtapshape
    landsets = system.file("from-gtapshape", "gtaplulc-aez18-sets.har",
                           package = "gtapshapeagg"),
    # Standard GTAP sets
    stdgtapsets = system.file("GTAPv11c", "gsdgset11cMV6.har", package = "gtapshapeagg"), 
    # Standard GTAP database
    stdgtapdata = system.file("GTAPv11c", "gsdgdat11cMV6.har", package = "gtapshapeagg"),
    # Directory where to output landgtapsets and landgtapdat
    dir= "AEZ18v11c"
)

g <- createdat(
    mapfile = system.file("mappings", "my_agg_AEZ18.txt", package = "gtapshapeagg"),
    setfile = "./AEZ18v11c/landgtapsets.har",
    datfile = "./AEZ18v11c/landgtapdat.har",
    ## Standard GTAP parameters
    stdprm =  system.file("GTAPv11c", "gsdgpar11cMV6.har", package = "gtapshapeagg"),
    ## Directory with aggregated data
    dir = "My_18AEZagg" 
)
```

The arguments `landdat`, `landset` and `mapfile` read the respective outputs created from `gtapshape`.
