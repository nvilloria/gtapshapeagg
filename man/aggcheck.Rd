\title{Check Aggregation Consistency for GTAP Data}
\usage{
aggcheck(mapfile, setfile)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapfile}{Gempack text file with aggregation template,
generated by gtapshape.}

\item{setfile}{HAR file with GTAP sets, including the subnational
bounds, also generated by gtapshape.}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. It performs consistency checks and creates temporary files.
}
\description{
Converts the text mapping aggregation template file to a HAR format
and runs a consistency check.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Calls \code{txt2map()} to convert the text mapping file to HAR format.
\item Creates an 'aggcheck.cmf' configuration file specifying input and output files.
\item Executes the 'aggcheck' system command to check aggregation consistency.
\item Removes the temporary 'aggcheck.har' file.
}

Input files:
\itemize{
\item mapfile: Text file containing aggregation mappings (converted to gmap.har)
\item setfile: Sets for disaggregated GTAP data
}

Output files:
\itemize{
\item gmap.har: Set mapping for aggregating data (created by txt2map)
\item aggcheck.har: Temporary file created by aggcheck command (removed after execution)
