readLines(mapfile).}

\description{
This function extracts values from a text file based on a given start pattern.
It reads lines from the file until it encounters an empty line, extracting
the first word from each non-empty, non-comment line.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Locates the line containing the start pattern.
\item Extracts all lines until it encounters an empty line.
\item For each extracted line, it keeps only the first word.
\item Removes empty lines and lines starting with '!' (comments).
}
}
\note{
This function assumes that the 'lines' variable containing the file
content is available in the environment where the function is called.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'lines' contains the file content
values <- extract.values("header \"H2\"")
}
